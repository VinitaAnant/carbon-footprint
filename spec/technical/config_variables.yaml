### 3. Usage and Best Practices

*   **Security:** All variables marked `secret: true` must be handled with extreme care. They should not be committed directly into source control. Instead, use environment-specific secret management solutions (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or `.env` files for local development that are not committed).
*   **Environment-Specific Files:** It is recommended to use separate environment variable files (e.g., `.env.development`, `.env.production`) or configuration management systems (e.g., Docker Compose `.env` files, CI/CD pipelines) to manage these variables for different deployment stages.
*   **Validation:** Implement robust validation in the application startup process to ensure all `required: true` variables are set and conform to their specified types and enums.
*   **Clarity:** Variable names are uppercase with underscores for readability and convention. Descriptions provide clarity on their purpose.
*   **Default Values:** While not explicitly in the schema, consider implementing default values within the application logic for `required: false` variables to ensure graceful degradation if they are not provided (e.g., `ENABLE_DATA_EXPORT_SHARE` defaults to `false`).
*   **Mobile Client Configuration:** For mobile applications, sensitive API keys or secrets should never be directly embedded in the client-side code. Instead, they should be fetched securely from a backend service or managed via secure key storage mechanisms provided by the operating system (e.g., Android KeyStore, iOS Keychain) if strictly necessary for client-side functionality. Public keys or non-sensitive configuration can be provided at build time.
